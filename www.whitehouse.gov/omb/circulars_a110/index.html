	___.3 <a name="3"></a><a href="#suba">Effect on other issuances.</a> For awards subject to this Circular, all administrative requirements of codified program regulations, program manuals, handbooks and other nonregulatory materials which are inconsistent with the requirements of this Circular shall be superseded, except to the extent they are required by statute, or authorized in accordance with the deviations provision in Section&nbsp;___.4.</p>

<p>
	___.4 <a name="4"></a><a href="#suba">Deviations.</a> The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may grant exceptions for classes of grants or recipients subject to the requirements of this Circular when exceptions are not prohibited by statute. However, in the interest of maximum uniformity, exceptions from the requirements of this Circular shall be permitted only in unusual circumstances. Federal awarding agencies may apply more restrictive requirements to a class of recipients when approved by OMB. Federal awarding agencies may apply less restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except for those requirements which are statutory. Exceptions on a case-by-case basis may also be made by Federal awarding agencies.</p>

<p>
	___.5 <a name="5"></a><a href="#suba">Subawards.</a> Unless sections of this Circular specifically exclude subrecipients from coverage, the provisions of this Circular shall be applied to subrecipients performing work under awards if such subrecipients are institutions of higher education, hospitals or other non-profit organizations. State and local government subrecipients are subject to the provisions of regulations implementing the grants management common rule,"Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments," published at 53 FR 8034 (3/11/88).</p>

<p>
	<strong>SUBPART B - Pre-Award Requirements</strong></p>

<p>
	___.10 <a name="10"></a><a href="#subb">Purpose.</a> Sections ___.11 through ___.17 prescribes forms and instructions and other pre-award matters to be used in applying for Federal awards.</p>

<p>
	___.11 <a name="11"></a><a href="#subb">Pre-award policies.</a></p>

<p>
	(a) Use of Grants and Cooperative Agreements, and Contracts. In each instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract). The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08) governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, "substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement." Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.</p>

<p>
	(b) Public Notice and Priority Setting. Federal awarding agencies shall notify the public of its intended funding priorities for discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute.</p>

<p>
	___.12 <a name="12"></a><a href="#subb">Forms for applying for Federal assistance.</a></p>

<p>
	(a) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with the applicable report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320, "Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public," with regard to all forms used by the Federal awarding agency in place of or as a supplement to the Standard Form 424 (SF-424) series.</p>

<p>
	(b) Applicants shall use the SF-424 series or those forms and instructions prescribed by the Federal awarding agency.</p>

<p>
	(c) For Federal programs covered by E.O. 12372, "Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs," the applicant shall complete the appropriate sections of the SF-424 (Application for Federal Assistance) indicating whether the application was subject to review by the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and address of the SPOC for a particular State can be obtained from the Federal awarding agency or the <strong>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</strong>. The SPOC shall advise the applicant whether the program for which application is made has been selected by that State for review.</p>

<p>
	(d) Federal awarding agencies that do not use the SF-424 form should indicate whether the application is subject to review by the State under E.O. 12372.</p>

<p>
	___.13 <a name="13"></a><a href="#subb">Debarment and suspension.</a> Federal awarding agencies and recipients shall comply with the nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12689, "Debarment and Suspension." This common rule restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.</p>

<p>
	___.14 <a name="14"></a><a href="#subb">Special award conditions.</a> If an applicant or recipient: (a) has a history of poor performance, (b) is not financially stable, (c) has a management system that does not meet the standards prescribed in this Circular, (d) has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award, or (e) is not otherwise responsible, Federal awarding agencies may impose additional requirements as needed, provided that such applicant or recipient is notified in writing as to: the nature of the additional requirements, the reason why the additional requirements are being imposed, the nature of the corrective action needed, the time allowed for completing the corrective actions, and the method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed. Any special conditions shall be promptly removed once the conditions that prompted them have been corrected.</p>

<p>
	___.15 <a name="15"></a><a href="#subb">Metric system of measurement.</a> The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. Federal awarding agencies shall follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, "Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs."</p>

<p>
	___.16 <a name="16"></a><a href="#subb">Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94-580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962).</a> Under the Act, any State agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with Section 6002. Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247-254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.</p>

<p>
	___.17 <a name="17"></a><a href="#subb">Certifications and representations.</a> Unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, each Federal awarding agency is authorized and encouraged to allow recipients to submit certifications and representations required by statute, executive order, or regulation on an annual basis, if the recipients have ongoing and continuing relationships with the agency. Annual certifications and representations shall be signed by responsible officials with the authority to ensure recipients' compliance with the pertinent requirements.</p>

<p>
	<strong>SUBPART C - Post-Award Requirements</strong></p>

<p>
	<strong>Financial and Program Management</strong></p>

<p>
	___.20 <a name="20"></a><a href="#subc">Purpose of financial and program management.</a> Sections ___.21 through ___.28 prescribe standards for financial management systems, methods for making payments and rules for: satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for program income, budget revision approvals, making audits, determining allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability.</p>

<p>
	___.21 <a name="21"></a><a href="#subc">Standards for financial management systems.</a></p>

<p>
	(a) Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to relate financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information whenever practical.</p>

<p>
	(b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the following.</p>

<p>
	(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in Section ___.52. If a Federal awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest.</p>

<p>
	(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.</p>

<p>
	(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to performance and unit cost data.</p>

<p>
	(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, payment methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, "Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under Federal Grant and Other Programs."</p>

<p>
	(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award.</p>

<p>
	(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation.</p>

<p>
	(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.</p>

<p>
	(d) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.</p>

<p>
	(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, "Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States."</p>

<p>
	___.22 <a name="22"></a><a href="#subc">Payment.</a></p>

<p>
	(a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205.</p>

<p>
	(b) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain: (1) written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient, and (2) financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in Section ___.21. Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.</p>

<p>
	(c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal awarding agency to the recipient.</p>

<p>
	(1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.</p>

<p>
	(3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used.</p>

<p>
	(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF-270, "Request for Advance or Reimbursement," or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special Federal awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer.</p>

<p>
	(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) cannot be met. Federal awarding agencies may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the project.</p>

<p>
	(1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not used.</p>

<p>
	(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.</p>

<p>
	(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.</p>

<p>
	(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time during the project period unless (1) or (2) apply.</p>

<p>
	(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting requirements.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, "Managing Federal Credit Programs." Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.</p>

<p>
	(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows.</p>

<p>
	(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2), Federal awarding agencies shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.</p>

<p>
	(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women- owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).</p>

<p>
	(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless (1), (2) or (3) apply.</p>

<p>
	(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.</p>

<p>
	(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.</p>

<p>
	(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.</p>

<p>
	(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.</p>

<p>
	(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this Circular, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.</p>

<p>
	(1) SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF-271, "Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs."</p>

<p>
	(2) SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute the SF-270 when the Federal awarding agency determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.</p>

<p>
	___.23 <a name="23"></a><a href="#subc">Cost sharing or matching.</a></p>

<p>
	(a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria.</p>

<p>
	(1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing or matching.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal awarding agency.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(7) Conform to other provisions of this Circular, as applicable.</p>

<p>
	(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of (1) or (2).</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to the project.</p>

<p>
	(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if (1) or (2) apply.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal awarding agency has approved the charges.</p>

<p>
	(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following qualifications.</p>

<p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal awarding agency in writing with the supporting reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award.

No Federal awarding agency shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j), do not require prior approval.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies for budget revisions whenever (1), (2) or (3) apply.</p>

<p>
	(i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.</p>

<p>
	(j) When a Federal awarding agency makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, the Federal awarding agency may require the recipient to request prior approval from the Federal awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to notify the Federal awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in the application unless the Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, Federal awarding agencies shall review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the Federal awarding agency shall inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.</p>

	(a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher education or other non-profit organizations (including hospitals) shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 USC 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations."</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 USC 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations."</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(c) For-profit hospitals not covered by the audit provisions of revised OMB Circular A-133 shall be subject to the audit requirements of the Federal awarding agencies.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(d) Commercial organizations shall be subject to the audit requirements of the Federal awarding agency or the prime recipient as incorporated into the award document.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	___.27 <a name="27"></a><a href="#subc">Allowable costs.</a> For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, "Cost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments." The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-122, "Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations." The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, "Cost Principles for Educational Institutions." The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, "Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals." The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.</p>

<p>
	___.28 <a name="28"></a><a href="#subc">Period of availability of funds.</a> Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the grant only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by the Federal awarding agency.</p>

<p>
	___.29 <a name="29"></a><a href="#subc">Conditional exemptions.</a></p>

<p>
	(a) OMB authorizes conditional exemption from OMB administrative requirements and cost principles circulars for certain Federal programs with statutorily-authorized consolidated planning and consolidated administrative funding, that are identified by a Federal agency and approved by the head of the Executive department or establishment. A Federal agency shall consult with OMB during its consideration of whether to grant such an exemption.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(b) To promote efficiency in State and local program administration, when Federal non-entitlement programs with common purposes have specific statutorily-authorized consolidated planning and consolidated administrative funding and where most of the State agency's resources come from non-Federal sources, Federal agencies may exempt these covered State-administered, non-entitlement grant programs from certain OMB grants management requirements. The exemptions would be from all but the allocability of costs provisions of OMB Circulars A-87 (Attachment A, subsection C.3), "Cost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments," A-21 (Section C, subpart 4), "Cost Principles for Educational Institutions," and A-122 (Attachment A, subsection A.4), "Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations," and from all of the administrative requirements provisions of OMB Circular A-110, "Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations," and the agencies' grants management common rule.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(c) When a Federal agency provides this flexibility, as a prerequisite to a State's exercising this option, a State must adopt its own written fiscal and administrative requirements for expending and accounting for all funds, which are consistent with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, and extend such policies to all subrecipients. These fiscal and administrative requirements must be sufficiently specific to ensure that: funds are used in compliance with all applicable Federal statutory and regulatory provisions, costs are reasonable and necessary for operating these programs, and funds are not be used for general expenses required to carry out other responsibilities of a State or its subrecipients.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<strong>Property Standards</strong></p>

<p>
	___.30 <a name="30"></a><a href="#property">Purpose of property standards.</a> Sections ___.31 through ___.37 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional requirements, unless specifically required by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided it observes the provisions of Sections ___.31 through ___.37.</p>

<p>
	___.31 <a name="31"></a><a href="#property">Insurance coverage.</a> Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the award.</p>

<p>
	___.32 <a name="32"></a><a href="#property">Real property.</a> Each Federal awarding agency shall prescribe requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, such requirements, at a minimum, shall contain the following.</p>

<p>
	(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Federal awarding agency for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the Federal awarding agency.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b), the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency or its successor Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall observe one or more of the following disposition instructions.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by the Federal awarding agency and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.</p>

<p>
	___.33 <a name="33"></a><a href="#property">Federally-owned and exempt property.</a></p>

<p>
	(a) Federally-owned property.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to the Federal awarding agency. Upon completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to the Federal awarding agency for further Federal agency utilization.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration, unless the Federal awarding agency has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, "Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals.") Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by the Federal awarding agency.</p>

<p>
	(b) Exempt property. When statutory authority exists, the Federal awarding agency has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions the Federal awarding agency considers appropriate. Such property is "exempt property." Should a Federal awarding agency not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	___.34 <a name="34"></a><a href="#property">Equipment.</a></p>

<p>
	(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions of this section.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority: (i) Activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency which funded the original project, then (ii) activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the Federal awarding agency. User charges shall be treated as program income.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of the Federal awarding agency.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include all of the following.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(i) A description of the equipment.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification number.</p>

<p>

<p>
	(iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment (not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(viii) Unit acquisition cost.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a recipient compensates the Federal awarding agency for its share.</p>

<p>
	(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the Federal awarding agency.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.</p>

<p>
	(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within that agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by the Federal awarding agency to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. The Federal awarding agency shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse the Federal awarding agency an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(4) The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to the following standards.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(i) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as appropriate.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(iii) When the Federal awarding agency exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned equipment.</p>

<p>
	___.35 <a name="35"></a><a href="#property">Supplies and other expendable property.</a></p>

<p>
	(a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies.</p>

	(a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was purchased, under an award. The Federal awarding agency(ies) reserve a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, "Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements."</p>

	(d) (1) In addition, in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for research data relating to published research findings produced under an award that were used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law, the Federal awarding agency shall request, and the recipient shall provide, within a reasonable time, the research data so that they can be made available to the public through the procedures established under the FOIA. If the Federal awarding agency obtains the research data solely in response to a FOIA request, the agency may charge the requester a reasonable fee equaling the full incremental cost of obtaining the research data. This fee should reflect costs incurred by the agency, the recipient, and applicable subrecipients. This fee is in addition to any fees the agency may assess under the FOIA (5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)).</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) The following definitions apply for purposes of paragraph (d) of this section:</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(i) Research data is defined as the recorded factual material commonly accepted in the scientific community as necessary to validate research findings, but not any of the following: preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer reviews, or communications with colleagues. This "recorded" material excludes physical objects (e.g., laboratory samples). Research data also do not include:</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(A) Trade secrets, commercial information, materials necessary to be held confidential by a researcher until they are published, or similar information which is protected under law; and</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(B) Personnel and medical information and similar information the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, such as information that could be used to identify a particular person in a research study.</p>

<p>
	(ii) <em>Published</em> is defined as either when:</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(A) Research findings are published in a peer-reviewed scientific or technical journal; or</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(B) A Federal agency publicly and officially cites the research findings in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law.</p>

<p>
	(iii) <em>Used by the Federal Government in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law</em> is defined as when an agency publicly and officially cites the research findings in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law.</p>

<p>
	(e) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and the recipient shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of paragraph ___.34(g).</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	___.37 <a name="37"></a><a href="#property">Property trust relationship.</a> Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property was acquired or improved. Agencies may require recipients to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition conditions apply to the property.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Procurement Standards</strong></p>

<p>
	___.40 <a name="40"></a><a href="#procurement">Purpose of procurement standards.</a> Sections ___.41 through ___.48 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or requirements shall be imposed by the Federal awarding agencies upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order or approved by OMB.</p>

<p>
	___.41 <a name="41"></a><a href="#procurement">Recipient responsibilities.</a> The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Federal awarding agency, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.</p>

<p>
	___.42 <a name="42"></a><a href="#procurement">Codes of conduct.</a> The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.</p>

<p>
	___.43 <a name="43"></a><a href="#procurement">Competition.</a> All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.</p>

<p>
	___.44 <a name="44"></a><a href="#procurement">Procurement procedures.</a></p>

<p>
	(a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum, that (1), (2) and (3) apply.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most economical and practical procurement for the Federal Government.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(iv) The specific features of "brand name or equal" descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the solicitation.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of measurement.</p>

<p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority- owned firms and women's business enterprises.</p>

<p>
	(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The "cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost" or "percentage of construction cost" methods of contracting shall not be used.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by agencies' implementation of E.O.s 12549 and 12689, "Debarment and Suspension."</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement documents, such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in the Federal awarding agency's implementation of this Circular.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000) and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a "brand name" product.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the small purchase threshold.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	___.45 <a name="45"></a><a href="#procurement">Cost and price analysis.</a> Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted, market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and allowability.</p>

<p>
	___.46 <a name="46"></a><a href="#procurement">Procurement records.</a> Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small purchase threshold shall include the following at a minimum: (a) basis for contractor selection, (b) justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or offers are not obtained, and (c) basis for award cost or price.</p>

<p>
	___.47 <a name="47"></a><a href="#procurement">Contract administration.</a> A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all purchases. Recipients shall evaluate contractor performance and document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract.</p>

<p>
	___.48 <a name="48"></a><a href="#procurement">Contract provisions.</a> The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts.</p>

<p>
	(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.</p>

<p>
	(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.</p>

<p>
	(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows.</p>

<p>
	(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The "bid guarantee" shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A "performance bond" is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.</p>

<p>

A "payment bond" is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.</p>

<p>
	(4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, "Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States."</p>

<p>
	(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall include a provision to the effect that the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.</p>

<p>
	(e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors shall contain the procurement provisions of Appendix A to this Circular, as applicable.</p>

<p>
	(b) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency with which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in paragraph ___.51(f), performance reports shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The Federal awarding agency may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.</p>

<p>
	(d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the following.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, or both.

<p>
	(1) SF-269 or SF-269A, Financial Status Report.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(i) Each Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to use the SF-269 or SF-269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF-269 or SF-269A when the SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF-269 or SF-269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF-270 is used only for advances.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal awarding agency requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of the documentation on hand.</p>

<p>
	(iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.</p>

<p>
	(iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit the SF-269 or SF-269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi-annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports.

The Federal awarding agency shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(ii) Federal awarding agencies may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the "Remarks" section of the report.</p>

<p>
	(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to report in the "Remarks" section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the excess balances.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF-272 15 calendar days following the end of each quarter. The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.</p>

<p>
	(v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following reasons: (1) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained in this section; (2) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; or, (3) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.</p>

<p>
	(b) When the Federal awarding agency needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, Federal awarding agencies shall issue instructions to require recipients to submit such information under the "Remarks" section of the reports.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) When a Federal awarding agency determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in Section ___.21, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time as the system is brought up to standard. The Federal awarding agency, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.</p>

<p>
	(3) Federal awarding agencies are encouraged to shade out any line item on any report if not necessary.</p>

<p>
	(4) Federal awarding agencies may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(5) Federal awarding agencies may provide computer or electronic outputs to recipients when such expedites or contributes to the accuracy of reporting.</p>

<p>
	___.53 <a name="53"></a><a href="#reports">Retention and access requirements for records.</a></p>

<p>
	(a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. Federal awarding agencies shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients.</p>

<p>
	(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as authorized by the Federal awarding agency. The only exceptions are the following.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.</p>

<p>
	(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.</p>

<p>
	(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. as specified in paragraph&nbsp;___.53(g).</p>

<p>
	(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by the Federal awarding agency.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(d) The Federal awarding agency shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a Federal awarding agency may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use.</p>

<p>
	(e) The Federal awarding agency, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.</p>

<p>
	(f) Unless required by statute, no Federal awarding agency shall place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Federal awarding agency can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to the Federal awarding agency.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).</p>

<p>
	(1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not required to submit to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.</p>

	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(3) By the recipient upon sending to the Federal awarding agency written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if the Federal awarding agency determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the grant will not accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made, it may terminate the grant in its entirety under either paragraphs (a)(1) or (2).</p>

<p>
	(b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in paragraph ___.71(a), including those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision shall be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.</p>

<p>
	___.62 <a name="62"></a><a href="#terminate">Enforcement. </a></p>

<p>
	(a) Remedies for noncompliance. If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, the Federal awarding agency may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in Section ___.14, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.</p>

<p>
	(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the Federal awarding agency.</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.</p>

<p>
	(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.</p>

<p>
	(4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.</p>

<p>
	(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.</p>

<p>
	(b) Hearings and appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.</p>

<p>
	(c) Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if (1) and (2) apply.</p>

<p>
	(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable. &lt;</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.</p>

<p>
	(d) Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and 12689 and the Federal awarding agency implementing regulations (see Section ___.13).</p>

Under this Act, contractors shall be required to pay wages to laborers and mechanics at a rate not less than the minimum wages specified in a wage determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors shall be required to pay wages not less than once a week.

<p>
	<strong>4. Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-333)</strong> - Where applicable, all contracts awarded by recipients in excess of $2000 for construction contracts and in excess of $2500 for other contracts that involve the employment of mechanics or laborers shall include a provision for compliance with Sections 102 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-333), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5).

Each tier shall also disclose any lobbying with non-Federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the recipient.</p>
