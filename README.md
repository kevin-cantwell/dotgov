### Keep an Eye on Your Masters

This project is an attempt to keep track of changes that occur on public-facing government websites. 

HTML pages are periodically and recursively fetched and pushed as a single commit. This makes it easy to 
view diffs since the previous fetch.

This project was inspired by [Amy Siskind's](https://twitter.com/Amy_Siskind) tenacious [Weekly Authoritarian List](https://medium.com/@Amy_Siskind) project.
